1. In order to make A[i] <= x, we need ceil(A[i], x) - 1 operations. 

2. We will perform binary search on the best value we can reduce the array to. 

3. We will check if it is possible to make the maximum of the array = X, by checking the number of operations required for this. 
If it is <= MaxOperations, then it is possible.
