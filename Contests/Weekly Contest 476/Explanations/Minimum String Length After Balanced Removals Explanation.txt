Let A = count(A) and B = count(B), 

It is always possible to remove min(A, B). 

Proof - Remove substrings of length 2 at a time. 

If there is at least 1 a and 1 b, they must intersect at some point. 
We can just remove this intersection. 

We will be able to remove 2 min(A, B) letters from the string.

        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
        {
            as += (s[i] == 'a');
            bs += (s[i] == 'b');
        }

        int common = min(as, bs); 
        int remaining = s.size() - 2*common;
        return remaining;
    }
