When you are asked whether you can reach a final state from a starting state, look for a monovariant or an invariant.
- This problem is asking us whether we can reach a point, starting from another point with certain allowed operations. 
- We can try all possibilities but a more elegant approach is to look for a property that either remains the same or always changes. 

# Approach - What happens to the GCD ? 
- g(x, y) = g(x - y, y) = g(x, y - x)
- g(2x, y) = 2g(x, y) or g(2x, y) = g(x, y)
- g(x, 2y) = 2g(x, y) or g(x, 2y) = g(x, y)
- The GCD either remains the same or doubles at each step. 
- This means that the final GCD must either remain 1 or be a power of 2.
