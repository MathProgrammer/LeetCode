We can use the Pigeonhole Principle to prove that such a number always exists 
if n is coprime to 2 and 5. 

Consider the first N strings of the form 1, 11, 111, 1111 and so on. 

There are only N possible modular classes (mod N). 

If any of them = 0 (mod N), we are done. 

Let us suppose none of them are = 0 (mod N). 
This means 2 of them must have the same value. 

Let them be 11... 1 (i times) = 11... 1 (j times) (mod N)

Without loss of generality, i < j 

=> 111... 1 (i - j times) 00 ... 0 (j times) = 0 (mod N)
=> 111 ... 1 (i - j times) x 10^j = 0 (mod N) 

if N is coprime to both 2 and 5, then N cannot divide 10^j. 
So N must divide 111 ... 1 

-----

We also know the length of such a string cannot exceed N. 

Simply try all such lengths till N. 

Only keep track of the modular value with N, not the actual value 1, 11 and so on 
as it might not fit inside 64 bits.
