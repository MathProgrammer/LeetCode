The final string will only have one occurence of each character. 
If any character occurs more than once, then we can perform the operation and reduce the frequency by 2 or 1. 

So, we will have to count the number of distinct characters in the string.

class Solution {
public:
    int minimizedStringLength(string S) {
        set <char> distinct; 
        for(char ch : S)
        {
            distinct.insert(ch);
        }
        
        return distinct.size();
    }
};
