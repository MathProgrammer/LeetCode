Let us re-orient the triangle like this 

A[0] 
x     A[1] 
x     x      A[2] 
x     x       x      A[3] 
G     x       x      x      A[4]

The G is the final goal. 

Let us count the number of times each array element is counted in G
The number of times A[i] is counted in the final sum is equal to the number of paths from i to G in this 
triangle only by going Down or Left. 

It is equal to the number of strings of length (N - 1) 
with (i) L's and (N - 1 - i) D's

This is C(N - 1, i)

-----

Precompute this using Pascal's triangle 

Do it MOD 10 because it grows very quickly.

Count the contribution of each element.

If N = 10^6, then we could precompute factorials instead of precomputing C(N, r)

        int n = nums.size();

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for(int r = 0; r <= i; r++)
            {
                if(i == 0 || r == 0)
                {
                    choose[i][r] = 1;
                    continue;
                }
                else 
                {
                    choose[i][r] = (choose[i - 1][r] + choose[i - 1][r - 1])%10;
                }
            }
        }
        
        long long sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
        {
            long long contribution = choose[n - 1][i];
            sum += (contribution*1LL*nums[i]);
            sum %= 10;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
