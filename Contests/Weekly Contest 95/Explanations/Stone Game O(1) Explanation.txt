The first player always wins !


Let us look at all the piles of odd indices - 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc

And all the piles at even indices - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc

Now, there are an equal number of odd index and even index piles !

----------------------------------

One of these has to be greater !

Let us say that the odd index piles have a greater sum ... Then pick pile 1 in your first move. If your opponent takes pile 2, then take pile 3. If your opponent takes pile N, take pile N - 1. 

Notice that for each of the first player's move, the first player will have two choices - Either take an odd index pile or an even indexed pile. 

So if the odd index piles have a greater sum, choose the odd indexed pile at ever step. (And vice versa if the even index piles have a greater sum !)
