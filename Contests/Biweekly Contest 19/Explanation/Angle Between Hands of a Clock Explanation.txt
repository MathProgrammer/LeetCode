Each minute is 6 degrees

Every 5 minutes is 30 degrees

We can find out the displacement of the minute hand easily

To find out the displacement of the hour hand,
we will first find out which hour it is and then how much
it is displaced within that hour by adding (minute/60)*30

{
    public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes)
    {
        if(hour == 12)
        {
            hour = 0;
        }

        double hour_degree = hour*30 + (minutes*1.0/60.0)*30.0;
        double minute_degree = minutes*6;

        double angle = abs(hour_degree - minute_degree);

        return min(angle, 360.0 - angle);
    }
};
