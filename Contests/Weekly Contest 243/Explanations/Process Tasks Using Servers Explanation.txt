Maintain two priority queues 

1. For the free servers - Ordered by (Weight, Index) 
2. For the occupied servers - Ordered by (Time)

# Maintain Two Priority Queues - Free and Occupied

- The priority queue of free servers is ordered by $(w, i)$
- The priority queue of occupied servers is ordered by $(t)$
- At the given second, we will first release all servers who's release time is $\le T$ and push them into the free queue.
- Then, we will assign the free servers to as many legal tasks as we have at that second.
- Be careful about the case where we have free servers remaining, but no more tasks. A task is legal if the index of the task is $\ge T$
    - If there are no free servers remaining, set $T \to O[t]$, where $O[t]$ is the smallest release time of any occupied server.
    - We don't have to process any second in between because there will not be any free servers in the interim.
    - If there is at least one free server, increase $T \to T + 1$ and see if we can assign free servers in the next second.
