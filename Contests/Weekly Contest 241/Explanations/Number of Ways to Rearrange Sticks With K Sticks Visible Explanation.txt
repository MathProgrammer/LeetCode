When we normally try to come up with a recurrence, we think about solving an instance of the problem of size (n - 1) and then adding n 

In this case, it is easier to come up with the combinatorial bijection if we imagine we are adding 1 to a permutation of [2, n]. 

Suppose we have solved the problem for permutations of [2, n]. 

Let us add 1. 

1. 1 is only visible if it is added in the beginning. There is 1 way to do this. 
2. 1 is not visible if it is placed in any of the other (n - 1) positions. 

f(n, k) = f(n - 1, k - 1) + (n - 1)f(n - 1, k)

The base case is f(1, 1) = 1
