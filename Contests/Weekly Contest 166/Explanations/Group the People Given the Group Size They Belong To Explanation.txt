1. Let us create an adjacency list. 

2. We will insert all people into list i, if they belong to a group of size i. 

3. Then, we will go through all the lists. 

If list i has exactly i people, then we will place them into 1 group. 

Otherwise list i will have m people where m is a multiple of i. 

We will create m groups of people of size i each.

----- 

At the end, we will create a vector consisting of all the groups that we created.

        vector < vector <int> > group_members_of_size(no_of_people + 1);

        for(int i = 0; i < no_of_people; i++)

            group_members_of_size[groupSizes[i]].push_back(i);

            vector <int> current_group;

            for(int j = 0; j < group_members_of_size[i].size(); j++)
            {
                int current_person = group_members_of_size[i][j];

                {
                    current_group.push_back(current_person);
