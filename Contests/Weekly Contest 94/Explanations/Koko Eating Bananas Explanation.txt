Let f(x) be the time taken to eat all the bananas if the eating time is speed = x.

We shall first prove that f(x) is a monotonic function. 

It is quite easy to see that f(x + 1) <= f(x)

f(x + 1) can never be slower than f(x). 

Since f(x) is a monotonic function, we can use binary search !

If f(x) > H, then the answer lies in [x + 1, 10^9] and we can discard all values smaller than x

If f(x) < H, then the answer lies in [1, x] and we can discard all values larger than x

This allows us to cut the search space in half each time !
