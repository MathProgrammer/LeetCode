There are 8 locks. 
We can iterate over every possible order of breaking them using bitmasks. 

Let f(m) be the minimum time taken to break all locks who's bits are set in m. 

Suppose m = 11000101

Then, let us iterate over the last lock that we will break in this combination. 
Suppose it is the second lock. 

Then the remaining m' = 1 0 00101

How much time is taken to break the second lock only ? 

Ceil(Strength[2], X) 

X = 1 + K* (No of open locks) = 1 + K * (No of bits set in m')

We can find out the number of locks open in m' by just counting number of set bits. 

So, f(m) = min{ time taken for a lock + f(m')}, for every bit set in m
