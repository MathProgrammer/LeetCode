Let us first observe that this is a monotonic function 

If we can make the string have blocks of size at most N, 
then we can do the same for N + 1

If the string does not have blocks of size N, 
it will also not have N - 1

This means that we can binary search it. 

-----

How to check if we can create a string with idential blocks of length at most X ? 

Let us do it in a greedy way. Suppose we find an identical block of length K 
How many do we have to flip ? 

We can just flip every (X + 1)-th character - This is K/(X + 1) 

If there is only one block of length X + 1, then flip the second last character to avoid increasing the length of the next block. 

----

X = 1 is a special case since there is no second-last character in each block. X = 1 consists of alternating strings, which means
the final string would either be 1010101.... or 010101... 
Evaluate the flips needed to reach either of these 2 strings and choose the minimum for the X = 1 case.
