This can be solved with a hash table or with brute force comparisons in O(n^2) time. 

But, there's a O(1) solution, Keep track of the sum of the array and subtract it from the expected sum of the first n natural numbers.

class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        int sum = 0;
        
        for(unsigned int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
            sum += nums[i];
        
        return (n*(n + 1))/2 - sum;
    }
};
